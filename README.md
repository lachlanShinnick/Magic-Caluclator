Calculator Website

This project presents a user-friendly calculator website named "The Magic Calculator." The webpage consists of an HTML structure with CSS styling for a clean interface.

Users can perform basic arithmetic calculations using the calculator's buttons for digits (0-9), arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), and special functions (AC for clear, DE for delete). 
The result is displayed in a text input field within the calculator interface.

The calculator website features responsive design. Styling elements such as rounded corners, shadows, and transition animations enhance the visual appeal and user experience.
